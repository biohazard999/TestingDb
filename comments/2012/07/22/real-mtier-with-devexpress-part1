      "Content": "> DevExpress, please think of us developers when designing your APIs, not business analysts and script kiddies :(\n\nYou certainly have the point here, and I as a developer can fully understand your \"righteous anger\". However, there is always the other side of the medal. By introducing EditorBrowsable(Never) and internal-use-only methods, and even keeping certain classes undocumented in our docs we try to save lives of a good number (if not the majority - call them VB.NET guys, if you want;-)) of our clients, so that they do not run into problems in the future by using some hidden APIs or suffering from changes or even removal of some undocumented classes. This \"care\" may affect guys like you, though. I am uncertain whether the golden mean exists here, but I think we are at least do our best maintaining the \"balance\", and let's be fair, not having \"every second method we like to use is fucking Browsable(false) or internal \";-)\n\n> Then, all of a sudden, DevExpress announced support for OData in combination with XPO. Hurray! Getting the hands on the first versions and the result was sobering. :(\n\nYeah, that is true. It was the first and unofficial/open-source implementation solely created by Azret and then posted on CodePlex. Later we just included his dlls into the installer to avoid versioning pain with often DXperience updates. The official (it also complies with MS OData implementation) OData support was added in XPO in 12.1 and we highly recommend everyone consider migrating to this version.\n\nFinally, I really liked your blog posts, keep them coming! It will be interesting to see how you will implement business logic, and not just expose an OData feed. At the moment I think that the only feasible way to keep several client applications that share a common business model/logic is using the XAF application server that will provide security, validation, audit and other business logic. In one turn, OData service used by mobile, WinRT, whatever clients will connect to this application server instead of the direct access to the datatabase. Let's also do not forget that although OData can be a \"common denominator\", it is not \"ideal\", especially as compared to basic feature XAF/XPO provide (I am talking about the lack of support for unsigned integers, enumerations, readonly properties, reference properties in descendants and numerous filtering limitations). Probably, this is not critical for mobile clients, though.",
