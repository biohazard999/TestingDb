      "Content": "Very interesting. You may want to look at Expecto for some ideas and I've also recently released CsCheck which has some new too. I am thinking if it's possible to build something Expecto like in C# using any of the testing frameworks underneath (so IDE integration for free) and using CsCheck also.",

      "Content": "Uh that's a nice project, didn't know about Expecto! Seams very similar to what I try to build, cause there the test projects are normal (console) programs as well! CsCheck also looks very promising and as far I can tell, works with Tasty.\nFor the IDE integration: I need to look into that, but the current focus is on building a stable CLI and look into xml reporters. I don't care so much about IDE integration yet, cause troubleshooting a singe test case is covered nicely with the `focused` (or I also like to call it the f*ck this mode :D)",
