See an example here: [https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/q558707/how-do-i-prefetch-related-details-data-to-increase-performance-for-calculated-fields](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/q558707/how-do-i-prefetch-related-details-data-to-increase-performance-for-calculated-fields) - just wanted to share a way to approach this using a Controller, not inside a persistent class.\n\nThis comparison of data access modes can also be helpful: [https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113683/concepts/ui-construction/views/list-view-data-access-modes](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113683/concepts/ui-construction/views/list-view-data-access-modes)\n\nThanks,\nDennis",
